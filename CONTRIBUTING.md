## Contributing to Twilight-Bot
* Contributes are always welcome because I'm not the smartest knife in the tree. If you do wish to contribute, thanks!

### 1. Black Style
I use Black to make my code look nice and pretty, you should too. To install Black, run `pip install black` in a virtual environment.

# Usage
In order to run Black, you will need to be in a cli in Twilight's directory. Then run ```black <path to file>``` or ```py -m black <path>```

If this fails, try running `pip install black` again.

# Testing
In order to test your changes, you should create a test bot on Discord's developer portal. After that, create a file in the root directory and create a `data` folder also in root. Run the bot and test your changes.

*Note, it is best to create a venv for your tests
